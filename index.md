Things you might want to know: B.A. in Music from Colby College, an M.F.A. in Acting from the National Theatre Conservatory, and an M.Ed. in Elementary Education from George Mason University. Trained EMT, lifeguard, Wilderness First Responder. Used to grow almost everything we eat. Can balance very large objects [painting ladders] on chin.

The following things are awesome: growing and baking things, volleyball, the bari sax, strawberry shortcake, old beat-up pickups, The Redwall Series, yoga, A & J King Artisan Bakers, New England, snow, Pupatella, sunrises, hot lemonade sweetened with maple syrup, home-made swings, deceptive cadences, and nachos, irony.

Currently our family is in foreign service in Nairobi, Kenya ðŸ‡°ðŸ‡ª. We will probably return to the US at some point.
